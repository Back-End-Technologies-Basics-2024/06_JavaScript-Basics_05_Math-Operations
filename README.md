Write a JS function that takes two numbers and a string as input. 

The string may be one of the following: '+', '-', '*', '/', '%', '**'.

Print on the console the result of the mathematical operation between both numbers and the operator you receive as a string.
The input comes as two numbers and a string argument, passed to your function.
The output should be printed on the console.


Hints
Write a function that receives three arguments.
Declare a variable named result that will keep your mathematical result. 

Write down the switch command that will take the string from your input and depending on it, perform the mathematical logic between the two numbers.
